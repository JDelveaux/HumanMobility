# HumanMobility
Work done for a PhD in Spatial Transport

 This document is a review of the work done on a PhD project entitled "The Effects of Transport
 Disasters on Human Mobility" during the period of October 2019- June 2020. It is broken up in to
 five sections including the introduction. The second section describes the acquisition of the transport
 data, including sources for data, types of data used, and how to make TFL API calls. The third section 
 describes the three transport models used during the project, including the assumptions made,
 data used, and empirical results. The fourth section discusses the data processing and visualization
 of inputs/outputs. The fifth section is a short discussion on what I have learned during the PhD
 process. The appendix includes a description of the included python code (see ’code’ folder) and
 the TFLLU/LO(TFL:Transport for London; LU: London Underground; LO: London Overground.)
